## How the webpage works?

It's a online web store, where you can buy the best mexican food.
Must be registered on the site to buy
with:
email
address
telephone
Name

Admin user can edit products details, price and storage.

## Routing
You can see the products but can't buy it without logged in, so some routes checks if the user is authenticated and if is administrator

## Database
Database stores all users, orders, buy history and products. I used order as a foreign table to  User and Order
